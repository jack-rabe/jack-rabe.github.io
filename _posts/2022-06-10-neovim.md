## Why try Vim?

Although modern IDEs like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and offering from JetBrains like [Intellij Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) offer a plethora of nice features and language-specific extensions, there remains a significant community of developer who keep returning to Emacs and Vim, the traditional text editors. After watching a co-worker navigate around the code base like a wizard, I figured Vim was worth checking out. It was quite a struggle starting out, but after sticking with it for several months, I feel much more competent in my ability to quickly and efficiently crank out some code. It is freeing to never have to pick up a mouse, and the ability to quickly customize your environment with an extensive offering of plugins or a couple lines of Lua or VimScript can't be beaten (in my opinion). 

## Installing Vim

I chose to install Neovim, which is a fork of Vim that focuses on code cleanliness to ensure greater extensibility. There are a few Neovim-specific plugins, but otherwise it doesn't make too big of a differnce which one you install. I use the Linux Mint operating system (this should also work for most Debian variants), so all I had to do to install was run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ninja-build gettext libtool libtool-bin autoconf automake cmake\
g++ pkg-config unzip curl doxygen # install build prerequisites
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim
cd neovim && make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Installation varies based on which operating system you are using, but more instructions can be found at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).

## Getting Started

Now that you have Neovim installed, you can start editing by entering `nvim name_of_file`. I won't go in depth to all of the functions of Vanilla Vim, but you can get a quick explanation by typing in `:Tutor`, which will bring you to brief tutorial page. It is also important to know that `:q` will allow to you exit Neovim.

## Plugins

Neovim is great by itself, but it becomes so much better with some plugins installed. There are several plugin managers, including Packer, Vim-Plug, Dein, and Pathogen. I haven't tried any of the others, but [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) has worked great for me so far. It can be installed on most Unix machines with:

```bash
sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
```

Now, you are able to install any plugins you want by adding something like the following section of code to your configuration file `~/.vimrc` or `stdpath('config') . '/init.vim'`. Each `Plug 'name'` line is a separate plugin that specifies the name of the GitHub repo for a plugin.

```bash
call plug#begin(stdpath('data') . '/plugged')
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
Plug 'tpope/vim-endwise'
Plug 'tpope/vim-rails'
Plug 'pappasam/coc-jedi', { 'do': 'yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn build', 'branch': 'main' }
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plug 'tpope/vim-repeat'
Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
Plug 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
Plug 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'
Plug 'preservim/nerdcommenter'
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plug 'justinmk/vim-sneak'
Plug 'NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme'
Plug 'morhetz/gruvbox'
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline-themes'
call plug#end()
```
I'd especially recommend trying out [Vim Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) for an improved Git workflow within Vim, [COC.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) to enable language servers and some nice autocompletion, and [Vim Sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak), which enhances the movement commands.
