Hello! I'm Jack Rabe. I am currently a computer science student at UW - Madison in Wisconsin. I have two younger sisters and pet dog named Pepper. I am from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and attended high school there at Winnebago Lutheran Academy. In my free time I enjoy running, playing soccer, and hiking. As a true Wisconsinite, I love my dairy products, especially extra-sharp cheddar cheese and Culver's concrete mixers.
